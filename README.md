    <h4>🧁 About the Shop</h4>
    <p><strong>Caffeine Bakery</strong> is a cozy yet modern bakery that infuses coffee flavors into delicious baked goods. The bakery aims to blend the warmth of a traditional café with a modern twist. The website was designed to be clean, elegant, and inviting—just like the aroma of fresh-baked espresso brownies.</p>
    <h4>🖥️ Website Design & Technologies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML5</strong> – for semantic and well-structured markup</li>
      <li><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> – to ensure a mobile-first, responsive layout</li>
      <li><strong>CSS3</strong> – for custom styling and design tweaks</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript & jQuery</strong> – for dynamic interactivity and smooth UI effects</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🎨 Design Guidance via Figma Mockup</h4>
    <p>The website structure and styling were guided by a complete UI/UX design built in <strong>Figma</strong>. The Figma prototype helped define the layout, color palette, font system, and component consistency across all pages.</p>
